# ACM CODES

This repository contains:

- Source code for solved ACM problems and a few not solved yet...
- Algorithms references for contests
- TODO problems (link to problem and/or initial source code)


These are most of the problems I have solved on the [ACM COJ](https://coj.uci.cu/) and [ACM UVA Online judge](https://uva.onlinejudge.org). By the code of honor for programmer do not copy the source code and submit them as if you would have solved it, but feel free to use the codes for getting some ideas and adapt to your own solutions, compare your solutions or any other thing you can do but copying and cheating with them
