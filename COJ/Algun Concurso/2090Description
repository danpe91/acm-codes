2090 - Number Sequence II
Description

A single positive integer i is given. Then you must write a program to find the digit located in the position i in the sequence of number groups S1S2...Sk. Each group Sk consists of a sequence of positive integer numbers ranging from 1 to k, written one after another. For example, the first 80 digits of the sequence are as follows:
11212312341234512345612345671234567812345678912345678910123456789101112345678910

But, it's not all!!!
Small Vlad is so enthusiastic with this sequence that he want that you find:
The digit between 0 and 9, located at the ith position?
The number N between 1 and maximum possible k, to which the ith position belong?
The group number Sk between 1 and maximum possible k, to which the ith position belong?

Input specification

The first line of the input file contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 100), the number of test cases, followed by one line for each test case. The line for a test case contains the single integer i (1 <= i <= 10^9).

Output specification

There should be one output line per test case containing the three numbers mentioned above.
